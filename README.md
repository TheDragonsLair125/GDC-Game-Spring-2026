This is the project for the Game Design Club at SUNY Poly's Spring 2026 collaborative project!

Rules
1. All commits have to be school-appropriate
2. Do not undo the work of others without permission or asking first.
3. Branches are your best friend! Feel free to make any amount you want! However, make sure you are being careful when merging with main!
4. Don't delete files from the repository without permission.
5. Make sure your commits have comments so people can tell what changes you made! (note not strictly enforced, but good practice and manners!)

Any violations of the rules will be dealt with by club executives on a case-by-case basis, though if something is deemed super aggresous you can get your account banned or lose uploading privileges!
